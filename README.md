# Tech-Blog

## Description
This app works as (nearly) full-stack application that allows users to register/login with their credentials and view, create, and comment on different blog posts.

The app uses Express.js for routing, MySQL as a relational database, Sequelize as an ORM, express-session npm to handle middlewware, and Handlebars as a template rendering engine.

Once front-end design is configured. It will be pushed to the Heroku cloud to be used as a live application.

## Instructions
To use this application, clone the repo to your system and then run an "npm install" command in your terminal.  It requires Express, MySQL, Sequalize, Handlebars, express-session, and express-handlebars to run - so make sure to run "npm i ___" command to install these dependencies as well. 

## Usage
Once the repo has been cloned and all dependencies have been installed. You can launch the application by running a "nodemon server.js" command.

Once operation, you can click on "register" to create your login credentials.  This will automatically log you in after registering.  When you later come back to the app, you will be able to use these same credentials to log in and view your profile. 

In your profile, you are able to create a new post and view all of your current posts.  You can also delete your old posts by clicking on the "delete" button next to them. 

You can also navigate the the home page where you can see all posts made by users on the app.  Additional functionality will be built in to allow you to comment on these posts as well. 

Once operational, you can also open up Insomnia, Postman, or another API design platform of your choosing to start interacting with the data using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE commands.

## Future Development
This application will benefit from a polished user interface and comment functionality.  I will be building these out as time allows.  If you are interested in helping with any of these features, please feel free to reach out at my email below.
